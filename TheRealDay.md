# The Most Productive Day 

Waking up everyday morning and thinking of grinding down some code, utilize every second ... at the end going back to sleep thinking where did I go wrong, why I can not create that kind of a day.

The answer I found was, I was wrong, it is very difficult to make a perfect day when I think, it comes after many days of trying to make it better, and one day you reach that day.

That day, I never realised it.
